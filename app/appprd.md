Technical Specifications (Suggested)Frontend: React or Angular (for a reactive and fast interface).Backend: Node.js or Python (Django/FastAPI).Database: PostgreSQL (ideal for complex relational data and security) or Firestore (if NoSQL/real-time is preferred).Hosting: Secure Cloud (AWS/Google Cloud/Azure) with servers located in Europe (GDPR requirement).6. Development Roadmap (Phases)Phase 1 (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):Login (3 roles).Patient Demographics Management.Basic Shared Agenda.Simple Clinical Record (text notes).Phase 2 (Advanced Management):Financial Module (Doctor advances and expenses).Inventory Module.Implementation of Manual Recalls.Phase 3 (Automation):Integration of automated SMS/Email.Advanced Reporting and Charts.File Upload (X-rays/Images).
